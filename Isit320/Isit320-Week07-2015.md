## Update WebStorm

- Open WebStorm
- Choose **Help | Check for Updates**
- Follow the link to [https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- Download web storm
- Close WebStorm

The following commands may differ if a new update of WebStorm has been released, but there should be enough information here to allow you proceed even if the commands differ because of updated version numbers.

Decompress:

```bash
tar xvfz ~/Downloads/WebStorm-11.0.0.tar.gz
```

Make sure Webstorm is not running. Now delete the old copy of WebStorm and put the new version in its place:

```bash
rm -r ~/bin/webstorm/
mv WebStorm-143.381.46/ ~/bin/webstorm
```

Restart webstorm:

- Do import settings
- Sign in again to your JetBrains Account if prompted to do so.

## Free Space

Go to the root of your repository. Copy the Gruntfile.js and package.json file from Week07-Twitter.

```bash
cp Week07-Twitter/Gruntfile.js .
cp Week07-Twitter/package.json .
```

Edit **package.json** so it looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "name": "Week07-Twitter",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon ./bin/www"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "grunt": "~0.4.2",
    "grunt-contrib-clean": "^0.6.0"
  }
}
```

And I also modified my **Gruntfile.js** so that it looks like this:

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt) {
    'use strict';

    grunt.initConfig({

        pkg: '<json:package.json>',

        clean: {
            yourTarget: {
                src: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/components/**']
            }
        }
    });

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-clean');
};
```

And then run **npm install**. Finally, to delete the folders, type **grunt clean**.

In other words, in the root of your repository, there should now be the **Gruntfile.js** and **package.json** files shown above. In the root of your repository, run these commands:

```bash
npm install
grunt clean
```

You only need to run npm install once, of course. But the irony here is that this command will delete you **node_modules** folder, so you will have to run **npm install** again after you run this **grunt clean**.
