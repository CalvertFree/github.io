Interesting Books
---------

Here is a beginning list of books available on the 24X7 site and 
elsewhere that you might find useful. If the book is not on 24X7, 
then I would not put it here unless I thought it was a great book. 
The books on the 24X7 site are all free, and so I include most of 
the ones connected to our course, regardless of quality. If I see 
one from 24X7 that I think is particularly good. I will put an 
asterisk after it.

Please check back from time to time, as I intend to keep adding to
this list.
