<p>So far, there are three assignments to do over the weekend.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-one-project-templates">Assignment One: Project Templates</h2>
<p>If you have not done so already, open up the HTML bundle in Aptana. There are two possible ways to do this. Pick the one that works on your system.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Commands | HTML | Edit this Bundle</li>
<li>Commands | Other | HTML | Edit this Bundle</li>
</ol>
<p>It may take a moment, but eventually you should see a new folder called HTML in your workspace.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>templates</strong> directory and find the file called <strong>project_templates.rb</strong>. Paste this code into the bottom of it:</p>
<pre><code>project_template &quot;Elvenware Angular Unit Test Project &quot; do |t|
  t.type = :web
  t.tags = [&#39;Web&#39;]
  t.icon = &quot;templates/HTML5_Logo_64.png&quot;
  t.id = &quot;com.elvenware.project.template.web.html5&quot;
  t.location = &quot;git://github.com/charliecalvert/AngularTest.git&quot;
  t.description = &quot;Remote template. Requires network access.&quot;
  t.replace_parameters = false
  t.tags = [&#39;Web&#39;]  
end</code></pre>
<p>Restart Aptana. Select <strong>File | New | Web Project</strong>. Select the project called <strong>Elvenware Angular Unit Test Project</strong>. Create the project as usually, filling in the name of the project. Run the two HTML files and confirm that they work.</p>
<p>Note that the template for the project is stored on GitHub, so you have to be connected for this to work. That's a drawback, but there are obvious benefits to pulling from a repository that I can easily update.</p>
<p>Submit a screen shot of your Aptana IDE with the &quot;Elvenware Angular Unit Test Project&quot; Template visiable. I want to see it in action, showing that it pops up the right thing after you choose <strong>File | New | Web Project</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use this as a template for any new Angular and Jasmine project that you want to create.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-two-snippets">Assignment Two: Snippets</h2>
<p>In JsObjects, go to the <strong>Utilities | Eclipse Tools</strong> folder. Grab the two files you find there and copy them into the <strong>snippets</strong> folder for the HTML bundle referenced in the previous assignment. Restart the IDE.</p>
<p>Open up a JavaScript file in Aptana. In the editor for the JavaScript file, type the letters <strong>csc</strong>. You should see at least three snippets beginning with the letters CSC. Take a screen shot and submit that screen shot.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="../Images/Snippets01.png" title="fig:" alt="Some CSC Snippets" /></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignment-three-unit-tests">Assignment Three: Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Start with the default project you learned how to create in Assignment 1 for this week. Modify the project so that you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert Miles to Inches</li>
<li>Convert Miles to Feet</li>
<li>Convert Miles to Yards</li>
<li>Convert Miles to Kilometers</li>
<li>Convert Kilometers to Miles</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a unit test for each method.</p>
<p>When you are done, the user of index.html should be able to perform each of the conversions. If we run Test01.html, we should be able to confirm that each of the conversions work. You should create at least a few unit tests that go after corner cases such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user enters 0</li>
<li>The user enters a negative number</li>
<li>The user enters a really, really big number</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't matter so much how your program performs in each of those cases, so long as your test defines how you expect the program to behave. This is a way of defining the spec for your API.</p>
<p>Soon, perhaps next week. We will learn how to raise and handle exceptions if we get unexpected input.</p>
<p>When you are done, upload your project to repositority and send me the URL. You can keep using your existing ISIT320 repository, and just put this assignment in a folder called <strong>Week04-UnitTests</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-four-code-academy">Assignment Four: Code Academy</h2>
<p>Provide a link to your Code Academy account showing that you have taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Fundamentals to at least: 66%</li>
<li>JavaScript to at least: 50%</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536">Example</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please put your picture in your Code Academy site, or link to your Google Site, or provide some other means of clearly linking yourself to the URL you provide.</p>
