# Code Academy Part VII

Bring both [JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
and [HTML CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) to 100%.

When you have reached 100%, submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**, like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

Remember, not just any page for the link, but a link to your profile page. One reason I ask for this is that you can show off your work to employers. To do that, you need to know how to provide a link to your profile page. This alone, of course, won't get you a job. But it has some value, and can be useful in a job interview.

Proposed weekly progress:

	Part 1:  15%
	Part 2:  30%
	Part 3:  45%
	Part 4:  60%
	Part 5:  75%
