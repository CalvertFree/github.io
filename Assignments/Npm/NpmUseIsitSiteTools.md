## Overview

In this assignment, to save keystrokes when typing, and cut down on noise when reading, I'll use some simple shortcuts. In particular, when I write **isit-code**, I'm referencing your **isit-code-lastname** project. When I write **isit-site-tools** I'm referencing your **isit-site-tools-lastname** project.

- isit-code => isit-code-lastname
- isit-site-tools => isit-site-tools-lastname

We will

- Link in **isit-code** to **isit-site-tools**
- Call from **isit-site-tools** to **isit-code**
- Write a react based project that displays the result of the call in the browser.

## Create Projects

Create a folder called **Week04-UseSiteTools** in your repository. In it, we need two projects called **client** and **server**. You have done this kind of thing before, so the process should be simple:

- create-react-app client
- CreateAllExpress server
