#Introductions

Use this thread to write a short personal introduction. I am interested in, and will read, all your contributions. I often will have occasion to refer back to these documents later in the course. I should add, however, that one of the secondary goals of this assignment is to be sure that you know how to use this Canvas discussion area.

Please write a short bio that includes the following:

- Your name
- Your background
- What you hope to get out of the course
- If you have a mobile device, tell us a little about it.
- Any interests you might have that you want to share with the class
- See my response below for an example of what to write.

Please reply to this question, not to my response to the question. In other words, you will see two possible places to respond to this thread. In this case, I want you to use the reply area immediately below this text. If you want to comment on someone's post, then you can reply directly to that post. It is perfectly fine to comment on someone's post, it is just not the place to put your own introduction. If this is not clear, see the Week01 Discussion where an example is available.
