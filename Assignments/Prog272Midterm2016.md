## Energy

We now want to start working with the file called **data/RenewableTypes.json**. I for see a problem here that we ought to address right off. We are already working with a file called **Renewables**. It will be too confusing if we are always trying to distinguish between **RenewablesTypesByYear** and **RenewablesByYear**. To avoid this, let's use **git mv** to rename  **data/RenewableTypes.json** to **data/HighTechEnergy.json**.

Create folders called **high-tech-energy** in **public/javascripts** and **views**.

## Hints

Be sure you renamed work.js to home.js. Rename all associated buttons, menus and files.
