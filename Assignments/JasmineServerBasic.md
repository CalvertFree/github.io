## Jasmine Server Side {#jasmine-node}

We want to be able to run tests that test our code on the server side, not in the browser. We will use Jasmine to do this. For instructions on how to set Jasmine up for these kinds of tests, see the following two sections of the Jasmine document on Elvenware:

- [Jasmine Server](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/UnitTests/Jasmine.html#jasmine-server)
- [Jasmine Reporter](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/UnitTests/Jasmine.html#reporter)
