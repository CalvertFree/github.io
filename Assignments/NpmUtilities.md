## Overview

In this project we are going to start creating some utilities and put them in our NPM package.

Put the following utilities in your utils.js file:

- writeFile(fileName, contents)
- readFile(fileName)
- padNumber(numberToPad, width, padValue)


## Pad Number

Given the number 5, the following call sets **result** to the string '005':

```javascript
var result = padNumber(5, 3, '0');
```
