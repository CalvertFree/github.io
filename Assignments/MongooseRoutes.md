## Description

In this assignment we will integrate our comments into our main application.

Key points:

- Establish a stand-alone **connect** object for connecting to Mongoose.
- Set up a separate route for **comments**. We don't route these requests throught **routes/index.js**. Instead, we set up **routes/comment.js**.
