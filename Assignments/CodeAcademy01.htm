<p>Code Academy</p>
<p>First, create an account on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a></p>
<p>After you have set up your account, I want you to complete some simple exercises in Code Academy. This should help you recall a few basic facts about HTML and JavaScript, in case you need to brush up on your skills.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Go to Web Fundamentals</a></li>
<li>Complete <em>HTML Basics</em> and <em>Build Your own Web Page</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Go to JavaScript</a></li>
<li>Complete <em>Getting Started with Programming</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When you are done, submit a link to your Code Academy <strong>profile page</strong>, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536">http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, if you have already completed the assignments, perhaps in another of my courses, you need only provide a link to your existing account. Or, if you want to work through them again, create a new account and start over.</p>
<p>I don't think you can delete work you have done and reset a course you have already completed. You can use the left panel to pick a section you have not done yet, but I don't see a way to completely start over.</p>
