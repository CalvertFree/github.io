It is a take home, you will have about a week to do it. I'm guessing it is something like:

- Same app, same name, new tag and/or branch both labeled midterm
- The menu and component switching
- Make at least two more requests of GitHub API and menu switches between views
- Possible extra credit: Integrate git-convert into the code so it converts JSON to field-definitions automatically
- And more tests.
- Polish.
