## Overview

It is a take home, you will have about a week to do it. Check back for updates, which will be announced if they occur, but the basic plan is this:

## Goals

- Same app, same name, new tag and branch both labeled **midterm**
- Include a styled menu and component switching
  - Home (This is the GitUser view)
  - GetFoo
  - Numbers
- Make at least two more requests of GitHub API
  - Include in the menu
  - Switches between all three Git views (The one we have plus two more)
- Possible extra credit: Integrate git-convert into the code so it converts JSON to field-definitions automatically
- You should have at least fifty meaningful tests.
- Polish.

## Turn it in

Add, commit, push, tag and branch. The tag and branch should both have the word midterm in their very short tag/commit message.
