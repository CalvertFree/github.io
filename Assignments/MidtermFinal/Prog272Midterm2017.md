## Overview

A description of what I want to see on the midterm.

## Goals

- Display at least three views:
  - **AddressShow**
  - **AddressEdit**
  - **SmallNumbers**
- Menu
  - Make sure you are [styling it](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp).
  - I picked the first of the **Horizontal Navigation Bar Examples**
  - Replace the default "Atom" **logo.svg** file with one of your own choosing.
- Iterate over at least 5 addresses
  - Be able to edit any of the address
  - Changes should remain through the session
- Testing
  - You should have at least 5 test files
  - **Address.test.js**, **AddressEdit.test.js**, **AddressShow.test.js**
  - **ElfHeader.test.js** and **SmallNumbers.test.js**
- Refactoring
  - Make sure you have the following folders with appropriate content:
  - **src/__tests__**
  - **src/components**
  - **src/css**
  - **src/images**
  - I'll get back to you with more details of how many tests I want to see, but for now, assume that 30 reasonable tests across all files.
