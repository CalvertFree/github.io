Create:

- **EnergyTypesController** in **public/javascripts/energy-types/energy-types.js**
- **energy-types-page.jade** in **views/energy-types/**
- **energy-types.jade** in **views/energy-types/**

When you load **energy-types.js** in **layout.jade**, don't forget that you need to specify the directory where it lives.
