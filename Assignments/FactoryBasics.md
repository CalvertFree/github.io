#FactoryBasics

Open the Factory Simple project:

- [Factory Simple](https://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects/tree/master/JavaScript/Design/FactorySimple01)

Study the [Osmani Spec][OsmaniSpec]. Notice the unit tests for 
the [Osmani Sloop][OsmaniSloop] class. In the same spec file, create 
similar unit tests for the [Osmani Yawl][OsmaniYawl] and Ketch classes. Make sure
there is a test showing that a Yawl has a mizzen and a Sloop has a
keel.
