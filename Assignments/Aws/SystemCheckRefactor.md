## Overview

Learn to refactor React components.

## Get Started

Let's start from the beginning again.

- Update JsObjects
- Navigate back to your repository
- Branch: **week07**
- Folder: **week07-system-check-refactor**
- Navigate into folder
  - **get-gist** and choose **Elven Create Concurrently**
  - Run **elf-concur**, choose s for server

## Eslint and Prettier

Install eslint and prettier

- get-gist and choose **Run ESLintRc and Prettier**
- echo 'build' > .prettierignore
- Run prettier, and it should clean both **client** and **server**.

We set up **.prettierignore** because we need to avoid trying to run prettier on our **client/build** directory.

## systemd

- cd server
- get-gist and run **Elven Node systemd Tools**
