## Overview

A tool for building web sites. Our goal is to take a project students built several years ago and update it to use React. We will:

- Clean up the code
- Improve and extend the tests
- Refactor the code
 - to have a cleaner architecture
  - to use React and Redux

## The Main Modules

There will be three main parts of this application:

- **ElvenWebCrafts**: A GUI front end for building websites from markdown.
  - It is based on code written in another of my classes that needs to be updated.
- **ElvenCode**: an NPM package written by students in another of my classes.
  - Also needs updating
- **ElvenSiteTools**: Code I wrote that needs to be improved

Each student will maintain their own copy of these projects.

## Create Your Packages

Create two NPM packages based on the code in **ElvenCode** and **ElvenSiteTools**. Append your name to these projects:

- elven-code-lastname
- elven-site-tools-lastname

For instance, in my case, the first NPM package would be called:

- elven-code-calvert

If you get the casing, the separater (a hypen), or anything else wrong, you will get the assignment kicked back at you. The names need to be exactly right.
