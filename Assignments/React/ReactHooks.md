## Overview

React Hooks, at the time of this writing (2019-11), have been around for about one year.

At this stage, it is clear that Hooks are here to stay. Many future React technologies will be built on top of React Hooks.

## Demo

We have a demo of you to use React Hooks in or **git-ignore-tests** repository. Clone
a copy of the repo into the **Git** directory. For this exercise, we don't want
to be using a copy of the repo that is involved with our midterm or anything
else.

Go to the command prompt and checkout the hooks branch:

    git checkout hooks

Navigate into **git-tester** and run **build**.
