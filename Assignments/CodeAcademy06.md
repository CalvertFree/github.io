# Code Academy Part VI

Bring one of the JavaScript and one of the HTML CSS courses to 90% or more:

- [Go to the old JavaScript course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
- [Go to the new Learn JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
- [Go to the old HTML and CSS course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
- [The new HTML and CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css)

When you are done, submit either a screen shot, or if you are at 100%, a link to your Code Academy **profile page**, like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

Remember, not just any page for the link, but a link to your profile page.
