## Folders

Divide your work up into Folders.

Put class work in one folder (walkingmap, etc.). Put your theme on another folder.

- How Light Works (This was an exercise created exploring the facets light.)
- Basic Markdown Exercises  
- Mapping Exercises  
- Image Camera

Put together a front page that points at each of these folders and explains what is in them.
