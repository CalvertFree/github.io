# BitlyQuery

Start with the default project you learned how to create in 
Assignment 1 for this week. Modify the project so that you can:

- Convert Miles to Inches
- Convert Miles to Feet
- Convert Miles to Yards
- Convert Miles to Kilometers
- Convert Kilometers to Miles

Write a unit test for each method. 

When you are done, the user of index.html should be able to perform
each of the conversions. If we run Test01.html, we should be able
to confirm that each of the conversions work. You should create at
least a few unit tests that go after corner cases such as:

- The user enters 0
- The user enters a negative number
- The user enters a really, really big number

It doesn't matter so much how your program performs in each of those
cases, so long as your test defines how you expect the program to
behave. This is a way of defining the spec for your API.

Soon, perhaps next week. We will learn how to raise and handle 
exceptions if we get unexpected input.

When you are done, upload your project to repositority and send
me the URL. You can keep using your existing ISIT320 repository, and 
just put this assignment in a folder called **Week04-UnitTests**.
