#Online Presence

In this class we use a variety of cloud services. Most of these services are free, or very inexpensive. This assignments is designed to help you establish a foothold in these various services.

To enter the world of modern computing, you must have a public presence in the cloud. Most people who fear developing a presence in the cloud exaggerate the importance of the threats they face. One of the main goals in this course is to teach you to use the cloud in a safe, secure and public spirited manner. To get started, you must begin actually participating in a carefully chosen set of cloud services.

##Turn it In

This assignment has many parts. To help you make sure that you complete everything, here is a check List of sorts: 

- Google Folder
- Google Doc
- Google Site
- Microsoft Folder (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)
- Microsoft Document (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)
- OneNote Document (Double check that you are using a Microsoft email address!)
- Twitter

- EverNote (Double check the email address!)
- OneNote (Double check the email address!)

- Turn it in: Press the submit button in Canvas!

**Sharing a document with another person involves associating the document with the right email address**. In this assignment, I spell the email addresses of mine to use when you share a document with me. Don't share everything with the same email address. Read the instructions carefully!

When you complete this assignment, press the submit button and enter the URL for your Google Drive folder, as described below.

**NOTE**: *Unless you have done this assignment before, you may well get it kicked back. Perhaps you will get it kicked back more than once. Do your best to fix your errors and then resubmit. **It is only when you resubmit the assignment that I know to check to see if it is now complete so that I can update your grade!** You cannot skip this assignment. To do well in most of my courses you must complete this assignment and complete it correctly.*

## What Account Should I Use?

Some of you may already have accounts for services like Google or Twitter. Should you use that account in this class?

Privacy is a personal subject. Some cloud services, such as Twitter, are very public. What you publish on Twitter for this class will likely be seen by your friends who use Twitter, and vice versa. Some people aren't bothered by this, others find it upsetting. If you already have an account with any of the services we will use in this class, and you don't feel comfortable using that same account for your class activities, then I recommend creating a second account with that service. 

**NOTE**: *It is possible to do some things in private on Twitter, and there are valid scenarios for doing so. Nevertheless, this class will focus on the public interface to Twitter.*

I find that some tools, such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, do such a good job of helping you separate public and private data, that there is no reason to have two accounts when using those services. However, if you are very fidgety about privacy, or process a lot of information on one of these tools already, then you might still wish to start a new account for this course even if you already have one for that service.

## Folder names

This assignment involves creating folders on Google Drive, OneDrive and Evernote. The name of your folder should contain three parts:

- The year
- The class name
- Your last name

Here are example names for each of my classes, pick the appropriate name for this class:

- 2015-Prog270-LastName
- 2015-Prog272-LastName
- 2015-Isit320-LastName
- 2015-Isit322-LastName

Where I write **LastName**, please substitute your last name. For instance, if this class is Prog272, then I would create a folder called **2015-Prog272-Calvert**. 

Here are some examples of **improper** folder names:

- Prog270-LastName -- > *Year missing*
- Prog272 --> *Year and last name missing*
- 2015-Isit320 --> *Last name missing*
- 2015-PROG270-CALVERT --> **Capitalization (casing) wrong**
- 2015_PROG270_CALVERT --> **Underscore rather than dash and case issues**

No one but you and me will ever see these folders. It is not a risk to use your name in their creation.

## Anonymity

As described above, always use your real name when creating folders. 

Please, if possible, also use your real name or some variant of it when creating new accounts and email addresses.  If you want to use an existing Google or Microsoft account, and your email address for that account does not fit in with my guidelines, then okay, I can live with it. But be sure, be absolutely sure, that when you share your folder with me that you name it correctly, as described in the previous section.

I understand, however, that out of a class of 30 people, one or two of you may have a real reason to want to remain anonymous online. If so, it is okay for you to use a pseudonym on public accounts so long as it is a recognizable variant on your real name. For instance, instead of Calvert, I could Colbert or Clavert.

If you create an email address such as **seattle25\@gmail.com** or a Google Site such as **bc-student-235** or **c00lgal56**, it will be very hard for me to figure out which account to link to which student. Please use your real name or some recognizable variant on your real name.

Some of the services I ask you to use are public, some are not.

**Public**:

- Twitter
- Google Sites

**Private**:

- Google Drive
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Evernote

When creating accounts on private services you don't need to worry about including your real name. When creating accounts on public services someone may be able to link an account name to you. This is an extremely, almost vanishingly, small possibility, but it is possible. In those cases, you can use a pseudonym of the type I describe above. If you use a name like **fancydude456**, and the account did not already exist, then I will probably kick the assignment back to you.

## Google

The first step is to create a Google Account if you don't already have one.

- Go to http://www.google.com and create a google account.  
- Set up a gmail account. (http://www.google.com/mail)
- Create a Google site (http://www.google.com/sites).

- In Google Drive (aka Google Docs) create a Google Folder and share it with me. See above for a description of how to name that folder.

- Use the email address shown below when sharing your Google Drive folder. This is not the same address you use when sharing Microsoft folders.

The email address to use when sharing your Google Drive folder:

-  **charliecalvertbc@gmail.com**

In your new folder, create a document called **OnlinePresence-LastName**, where LastName is your last name. It should contain the same information as found in the HTML document described below. When creating documents and folders I will often say that you should name it XXX-LastName. I mean, of course, for you to substitute your last name for the word LastName. For instance, Isit320-LastName would become Isit320-Calvert in my case.

See the following for information on working with Google Drive:

- <http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/os/Android/AndroidApplications.html#googleDocs>

## The Google Document Assignment

This assignment is designed to ensure that you understand Google Drive. Please step carefully through this part of the assignment and make sure you have all the details right.

When you are ready to submit this assignment, name it **OnlinePresence-LastName**, and place it in your Google Docs folder. Please share both the folder and the document with my **charliecalvertbc@gmail.com** account. Be sure I have rights to edit this document, your folder and everything you submit via Google Docs. In general, if you first share the folder with me, then everything you place in the folder should be shared with me automatically.

### The Google Document

Create a document called **OnlinePresence-LastName**, where LastName is your last name. Example: **OnlinePresence-Calvert**. Your document should include the following information in hyperlinked list elements.

- The email for your Google account.
- The URL for your Google Web Site(s)
- The URL for your Twitter Account(s)
- The email for your Microsoft Account. Also tell me if you own a copy of Microsoft Office.

In Figure One, I give an example of the type of document I want you to create. Your document will include more data and more links.

![OnlinePresence](../Images/OnlinePresnce01.png)

Figure 1: Here is the type of Google Docs file I want you to create. You do not need to use the same colors.

![OnlinePresence02.png](../Images/OnlinePresnce01.png)

Figure 2: Sharing a document in Google Docs. 

The dialog shown in Figure 2  was instantiated when I pushed the Share button seen in the background near the top right of the screen. It will be shared when I enter a valid email address and push the **Send** button. Think long and hard before you enter the email address. ***Is it the right address***?

## Google Site Creation
Besides creating a document in Google Drive, I also want you to create a Google Site. This is a free web site that you can use to publish data or to experiment with web services. Here is the URL of my site, so that you can have an example of what I'm asking you to do:

- <https://sites.google.com/site/elvenware/>

After you have created your google account, it takes only a single click to begin creating a web site. After clicking the button you should choose to:

- Use the blank template (the default)
- Name your site. You will be able to edit the name later. (If you need an idea, use **firstnamelastnamebc**. For instance: **charliecalvertbc**.
- Create the last word of the URL for your site. Choose a single word using alphanumeric characters. It helps to create a URL that is easy to remember and type. I used **elvenware**.
- Choose a theme. This is your choice and can be changed later.
- Open up More Options, give your site a description and choose to share it with everyone.
- Enter the captcha.
- Click Create Site

After creating the site choose **More Actions | Manage Site | Automatically Adjust Site to Mobile Phones**.

If things go completely awry, you will be able to delete the site and start again. In that case, choose **More Actions | Manage Site| Delete Site**.

## Twitter

If you don't already have one, create a Twitter Account. To get started, you need only enter a name, an email address and a password. Again, you could use a name like **FirstNameLastNameBc**, where **FirstNameLastName** is your first and last names. For instance: **charliecalvertbc**.

Please make your account public. If you don't want your regular Twitter account to be public, then please create a separate account for this course that is public.

**NOTE**: *Twitter allows you to broadcast short phrases to the world. There are scenarios in which it makes sense to broadcast to a private group, but in general, the purpose of Twitter is to broadcast messages to anyone who wants to listen. In this course, we are exploring the cloud as it presents itself to the world. Public Twitter accounts are one of the major hubs in the cloud, and it is important that you learn how to use them.*

After you create the account, you will be taken through a wizard that helps you get plugged in to the Twitter community. There is a “Skip this step” option to help you move through the prompts, or you can fill in any available options that you find appealing.

After you are set up, you should edit your Profile from the black menu bar at the top of the page. Make sure your twitter account Profile includes:

- Your name.
- A picture of yourself
- A short bio
- A url pointing to your your web site, which could be the Google site we just created, or some other site if you prefer to use it.
- For your location you can just enter Washington, or be more specific if you want. For instance, you could enter Bellevue, WA.
- Follow my [CalvertBc](https://twitter.com/CalvertBc) Twitter account and leave a message to @calvertbc announcing your presence. Remember tweets are 140 characters or less, so keep you message short. To see who has left you a post, choose @mentions from your menu bar.

The last time I looked, it was not particularly easy to delete a twitter account. If you make a mistake and want to start over, you can try searching for solutions on the web, or just abandon the corrupted account and create a new one.

Sooner or later some student always seems to ask: "Why Twitter?" That is a reasonable question. Twitter is an odd tool, but it is particular well suited for use on mobile devices because it works with small chunks of text. It is true that a huge amount of useless junk is posted on Twitter every day. On the other hand, some of the smartest and most powerful people in the world have Twitter accounts and use them regularly, sometimes to great effect. This is particularly true in the development world. Lot's of smart developers post to twitter regularly, and following them can be very useful. It is a great way to see what [the best minds in the industry][tweetbest] are thinking.

I have also found that many people don't really understand how Twitter works or how to use it. Everyone should know how to use Twitter. It is a part of the fabric of modern life. We will not spend much time with Twitter, but I do want to be sure that everyone who passes through my mobile and cloud courses understands this relatively simple tool, and knows how to use it.

## Microsoft OneDrive

If you don't have one already, go to Microsoft's Live website and [Create an account](https://onedrive.live.com?invref=441f942a988a6348&invsrc=90). 

You should then sign in to Live and go to your **OneDrive**. Just as you did in Google Drive, use **OneDrive** to create a folder with the same naming convention you used in the Google Section. In particular, name the folder Prog270-LastName, where LastName is your name and Prog270 is the name of the course you are taking. For instance, my folder might be named **Prog270-Calvert**, **Isit320-Calvert**, **Prog272-Calvert**, **Prog219-Calvert**, **Isit322-Calvert**, and so on, depending on the course you are currently taking. On both Google Drive and OneDrive you can rename a folder you have shared if necessary. You don't have to share it again. Just rename it.

Share the folder with me, using my Live ID for Bellevue College work:

- **charliecalvertbc@hotmail.com**

**NOTE**: *Though they can easily be confused, the **hotmail** address shown above is not the same as the **gmail** address used in other sections of this document. In some of my courses confusing them can cost you points in multiple assignments including the midterm and the final. Because the mistake can be propagated across so many parts of the course, it can easily move your grade down a whole letter. For instance, it can change your final grade from an A to a B, or from a B to a C.*

Put the same document in it that you put in the Google Drive folder.

## Microsoft OneNote

Also create a note with Microsoft One Note. OneNote is part of **OneDrive**. Share it with me, just as you did your **OneDrive** document. **In particular, put it in the same *OneDrive* folder where you placed your other Microsoft related documents.** Double check to make sure you are sharing the folder with the Microsoft email specified in the section on **OneDrive**.

Don't forget, if you have trouble, join the discussion group and ask for help! Don't spin your wheels!

## Evernote 

You should do much the same thing in [Evernote][1] as you did in Google Drive and in Microsoft SkyDrive. Your Evernote notebook, however, is read only for those who share it. You have to pay to create a notebook that more than one person can edit. There is not need to perform the upgrade to the paid version in this course.

Create a new synchronized notebook by choosing **File | New Notebook**. Place some or all of your document in an Evernote note that is part of this notebook. Choose Synchronize. Now switch to the share tab, choose **Manage Shares** and share it with:

-  **charliecalvertbc@gmail.com**

**NOTE**: *For a long time, on the desktop, I found it easier to actually install Evernote as an application, rather than using the web based tool. I'm not sure that is still the case, but nevertheless the install is not a bad idea. If you can't install the desktop application, then you will now find the web based application adequate.* 

Steps:

- Install the Evernote app. There is one for the PC.
- Choose: File | New Notebook (Ctrl-Shift-N)
- Create a synchronized notebook called **2014-Isit320-LastName**, where LastName is your last name.
- Right click on the new notebook and choose Share.
- Share the notebook with charliecalvertbc@gmail.com
- Put a note in the notebook
- More information is found here:
    - <http://elvenware.com/charlie/os/Android/AndroidApplications.html#evernote>

**TIP**: *Many students struggle to learn how to place a message in a shared Evernote notebook. One technique that may help some students is to add content to Evernote by sending email. That will allow you to automate the process of adding notes to Evernote in the correct folder with a default tag. Assuming you have already created your folder, and already tagged one message with the tag **Isit320**, then you can send a message to the correct folder by creating a subject line something like this:*

- Test Message @2014-Isit320-LastName #Isit320

*If the message you see in Evernote has **#Isit320** in the title, then you may have forgotten to first create the tag in Evernote before sending the message. More information is found in the [Evernote documentation][2].*

## Should I Use a Mobile Device or a Desktop PC?

I use my desktop for tasks like those described here. However, it is possible to complete many of them on a mobile device. Please feel free to try, and if it becomes too frustrating, switch to the desktop. I have chosen these cloud applications because they are useful additions to mobile devices. That does not mean, however, that you have to set up the accounts on those devices.

## Passwords

I have well a number of online accounts. To help me manage the passwords for those accounts, I use a service called [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/). Getting some people to feel comfortable using services such as Google or Evernote can be difficult, getting them to trust their passwords to LastPass is much more challenging. 

During this quarter, many of you will curse and fret as you attempt to manage your passwords. I have one suggestion: use LastPass or some similar password manager. 

Eventually, most of us will end up using LastPass or a similar service. Exactly when you make the transition can be calculated by dividing your tolerance for pain over your propensity towards paranoia.

## Account Creation

I provide a certain amount of guidance on creating accounts. If you need more information, please use the discussion area to ask questions, or refer to [this Elvenware document][elf-app].
