Use BitBucket (Links to an external site.) to host a private git repository. You have two choices:

Create a new BitBucket account if you don't have one already
Use an existing BitBucket account.
In the account, create a new repository. Name your git repository like this:

isit322_lastname

For instance:

isit322_calvert

Make sure you give me read/write access to it. Use the send invitation link and use ccalvert as my id.

And most important, include a .gitignore with the following items in it:

node_modules
.metadata
.idea
Thumbs.db

Please include the URL of your repository when you post this assignment in Canvas.

Follow the instructions in "I'm starting from scratch" using the video as a guide to a few slight variations such as creating the .gitignore file with at least node_modules in it.
When you are done, on the overview page choose send invitation, type in ccalvert and give me read write privileges.
