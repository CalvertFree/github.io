Similar to ElfLogNpm and ElfLogBower, but this time make sure you are using your own packages for both NPM and Bower. Instead of buttons, put three checkboxes and three radio buttons. The messages should appear as you click the checkboxes and radio buttons.

Here is how I export the **elf-log** in index.js:

```javascript
exports.elfLog = elfLog;
```

Put your work in **Week08-ElfLogBower**.

You don't need to recreate NPM and Bower packages, just use the one's you created for previous assignments.
