Node Modules Assignment
===========

Examine the [NodeModules](https://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects/tree/master/JavaScript/NodeCode/NodeModules) program in JsObjects.

Create a program of your own with three modules:

- Module01
- Library/Module02
- Public/Module03

Also create a file called **server.js** that use all three modules.

In **Module01** export methods that add, multiply and subtract two whole numbers. 

In **Module02** export a method that will convert feetToMiles.

In **Module03** use the Modular pattern and expoert a method that takes a single whole number and returns its square.

The output from all the exported function should be visible after they are called from **server01.js**.
