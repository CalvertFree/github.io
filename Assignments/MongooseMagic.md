In a folder called **Week10-MongooseMagic**, check in **LEA.json** and the JSON files for any two other MTG sets.

Include four screen shots when you submit the assignments. Attach the screenshots to the assignment itself in either PNG or JPG format. 

The screen shots:

- Your mongolab main database page before you insert **magic-sets** and **magic-cards**.
- Your mongolab main database page after you insert **magic-sets** and **magic-cards**.
- A view of the data from **magic-sets** on MongoLab. There is nothing special needed here, just the default view of the collection when you view it on MongoLab.
- A screen shot of the command line on your system after you finish running this command:
    - node WriteMagic.js
