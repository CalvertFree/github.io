# Overview

Learn to use Hangouts

## Basics

You will need to have a Google account.

Use Chrome or Chromium. Log into your account.

- Open the Settings menu for Chrome. (This is the Hamburger menu on upper right.)
  - Or go to this URL: **chrome://settings/**
- Choose **Bookmarks | Show Bookmark Bar**. (Ctrl + Shift + B)
- Click the little **Show Apps** icon on the far left of the Bookmarks bar.
- Go to the WebStore and install [Hangouts][ho].

Then send me a message using the address I gave you in class.

## Video

We are going to want to share our screens. In particular, you will need to see my screen. I have a feeling that before we can share our screens we need to enter a video conversation. But you do not need to have a webcam. You should, however, have a microphone. Most laptops have both. Check, however, that you don't have your camera somehow turned off.
