- Choose **Bookmarks | Show Bookmark Bar**. 
- Click the little **Show Apps** icon on the far left of the Bookmarks bar.
- Go to the WebStore and install Hangouts.

## Video

We are going to want to share our screens. In particular, you will need to see my screen. I have a feeling that before we can share our screens we need to enter a video conversation and to enter a video conversation you need a webcam. So that is something you should own. Of course phones and chromebooks nearly always have cameras built in, and most laptops have cameras. So it should not be an issue. Check, however, that you don't have your camera somehow turned off.
