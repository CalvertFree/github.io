# Prog 270 Midterm 2014

Your goal is to create three websites that can be viewed in:

- Desktop Browser
- Mobile browser

The websites will be hosted on:

- EC2
- S3
- Google Sites

 You will also create three documents that can be viewed in a

- Google Drive
- OneDrive
- Evernote

- The Android or other device applications for Google Drive, OneDrive and Evernote.


In general. The theme of this exercise is the creation of content that can be viewed on mobile devices. As a result, you should test your web pages to make sure they look good on a mobile device. At the very least, you should use Chrome and FireFox device emulation to test your pages. If possible, also view your pages on your mobile phone or tablet.

## Create Documents

You will use stackedit to create at least 5 documents. Three of the documents can contain any content that interests you. I don't much care what documents you create, but if you want suggestions, here are a few:

- Tech Skills
- Interests or Hobbies
- Favorite Books
- Favorite Movies
- Favorite Music 
- Map page

All three of the pages must have pictures in them, and at least two of the pictures you display must be one's that you created yourself.

You should also create:

- A front page that contains a TOC. The TOC should consist of live hyperlinks to the five pages you created. 

- An about page which tells us something about the author. If you wish, you can make up the author, or include real information about yourself.
- A front page called **index.html** that contains a TOC. The TOC should consist of live hyperlinks to the four pages you created.

## Display Your Documents on the Web

Your website should be placed on:

- Your EC2 instance.
- S3 
- Your Google Site

Use Git to load your pages on to EC2. This means that you will need to place your pages on CodeAnywhere so that you can put them in Git.

**NOTE**: There are many other tools for accessing Git, but we are not allowed to install these tools on the machines in N252. So we do our work in CodeAnywhere.

On EC2, you will copy your files into the /var/www/html directory so they can be accessed over the web.

## Markdown, HTML and CSS

Place your markdown, HTML and CSS files in our shared folders on Google Drive and OneDrive. In both cases place them in a folder called **MidtermDocuments**.

## Images

Store at least two images from your web pages in our shared folders on Google Drive and OneDrive. In both cases, place them in a folder called **MidtermImages**.

## Standard Documents

Recreate the three main pages you created in StackEdit in a Google Document and in a Word document on One Drive. Also do your best to create the documents in our shared Evernote folder. You do not need to create the Front Page or the About page for this part of the exercise.

```
	function foo() {
	  console.log('bar');
	}
```
