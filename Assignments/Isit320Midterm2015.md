# Isit320 Midterm 2015

Polish the **BitlyRefine** and **TwitterRefine** programs. Create a program for viewing images stored in the cloud. The program should integrate both Bitly and Twitter. In particular, you should be able to view a *gallery* of images created from Bitly links or Twitter posts.

## Image Viewing

There are two ways that I know about for storing images in the cloud:

- Free services
- Pay services

Both Google Photos (with Picassa Web) and Imagur provide at least a limited ability to create galleries and show them on your web site. However, these services have real limitations, and they feel, to me at least, a bit tentative, as if they may not be available for very long.

For the final I want you to get these services up and running. You will then store links at least two of these services:

- Bitly
- Delicious
- Twitter

## AWS S3

When all is said and done, I think the simplest way to store images in the cloud that you want to view on your web site is to pay for it. To make a long story short, Amazon Web Services S3 option allows you store images in the cloud for pennies a month. For instance, most of the images that you see on our Isit320 web sites are stored on S3, and I paid three cents last months for the privilege.

It simply makes no sense to go through the hastle of trying to get around the limitations of the Google and Imagur services when Amazon provides such an inexpensive solution.

One pay service that I use frequently is Amazon Web Services S3. Anyone can create an AWS account and use it (within reason) for one year for free. After that, you need to start paying.

First sign up for the free tier or sign into your existing account. Then start to [use S3][use-s3].
