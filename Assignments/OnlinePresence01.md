## Overview

In this class we use a variety of cloud services. Most of these services are free, or very reasonably priced. This assignments is designed to ensure that you have a foothold in these various services.

Our focus will be on learning to use the cloud in a safe, secure and public spirited manner.

In particular, we will be asked to create a Google Account if you don't already have one. Here is a summary of what I want you to do:

- Go to http://www.google.com and create a google account.  
- Set up a gmail account. (http://www.google.com/mail)
- Create a Google site (http://www.google.com/sites).
- In Google Drive (aka Google Docs) create a Google Folder and share it with me. See above for a description of how to name that folder.
- Use the email address shown below when sharing your Google Drive folder. This is not the same address you use when sharing Microsoft folders.

## Video

A number of years ago I created a video showing how to share documents on Google Drive. Parts of it are now outdated, but the process is substantially still the same, so I'll continue to use it:

## My Email

The email address to use when sharing your Google Drive is shown below. So that black hat snoopers can't find my email too easily, I have translated it into plain English. It should, however, be a simple task for you to convert it into a normal email address:

-  **charliecalvertbc at gmail dot com**

## Folder names

This assignment involves creating folders on Google Drive, One Drive and Evernote. The name of your folder should contain three parts:

- The class name
- Your last name
- The year

Here are example names for each of my classes, pick the appropriate name for this class:

- Prog270-LastName-2017
- Prog272-LastName-2017
- Isit320-LastName-2017
- Isit322-LastName-2017

Where I write **LastName**, please substitute your last name. For instance, if this class is Prog272, then I would create a folder called **2015-Prog272-Calvert**.

Here are some examples of **improper** folder names:

- Prog270-LastName -- > *Year missing*
- Prog272 --> *Year and last name missing*
- Isit320-2017 --> *Last name missing*
- PROG270-CALVERT-2017 --> **Capitalization (casing) wrong**
- PROG270_CALVERT-2015 --> **Underscore rather than dash and case issues**

If you get the casing or name wrong then I might not find your folder at all, and it will certainly cause me extra work to sort through long lists looking for your folder. I depend on folders being sorted properly. If you don't name your folder properly then it most likely will not be sorted properly.

No one but you and me will ever see these folders. It is not a risk to use your name in their creation.

## The Google Document Assignment

This assignment is designed to ensure that you understand Google Drive. Please step carefully through this part of the assignment and make sure you have all the details right.

When you are ready to submit this assignment, name it **OnlinePresence-LastName**, and place it in your Google Docs folder. Please share both the folder and the document with my **charliecalvertbc@gmail.com** account. Be sure I have rights to edit this document, your folder and everything you submit via Google Docs. In general, if you first share the folder with me, then everything you place in the folder should be shared with me automatically.

In your new folder, create a document called **OnlinePresence-LastName**, where LastName is your last name. It should contain the same information as found in the HTML document described below. When creating documents and folders I will often say that you should name it ???????-LastName-201?. I mean, of course, for you to substitute your last name for the word LastName. For instance, **Isit320-LastName-2017** would become **Isit320-Calvert-2017** in my case.

### The Google Document

Create a document called **OnlinePresence-LastName**, where LastName is your last name. Example: **OnlinePresence-Calvert**. By the time you finish all the parts of this assignment, your document should include the following information in hyperlinked list elements.

1. The email for your Google account.
- The URL for your Google Web Site(s)
- The URL for your Twitter Account(s)
- The email for your Microsoft Account. Also tell me if you own a copy of Microsoft Office.
- The email for your Evernote account

This part of this assignment, only involves the first two steps:

1. The email for your Google account.
- The URL for your Google Web Site(s)

In Figure One, I give an example of the type of document I want you to create. Your document will include more data and more links.

Figure 2: Sharing a document in Google Docs.

The dialog shown in Figure 2  was instantiated when I pushed the Share button seen in the background near the top right of the screen. It will be shared when I enter a valid email address and push the **Send** button. Think long and hard before you enter the email address. ***Is it the right address***?

## Google Site Creation

Besides creating a document in Google Drive, I also want you to create a [Google Site][gsite]. More specifically, I want you to create a [New Google Site][ngsite] These sites are free. In my opinion they are not create places to create generic websites, but they are useful when you want to share content creating on with Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc.

After you have created your google account, it takes only a single click to begin creating a web site. After clicking the button you should choose to:

- Use the blank template (the default)
- Name your site. You will be able to edit the name later. (If you need an idea, use **firstnamelastnamebc**. For instance: **charliecalvertbc**.
- Create the last word of the URL for your site. Choose a single word using alphanumeric characters. It helps to create a URL that is easy to remember and type. I used **elvenware**.
- Choose a theme. This is your choice and can be changed later.
- Open up More Options, give your site a description and choose to share it with everyone.
- Enter the captcha.
- Click Create Site

After creating the site choose **Manage Site | General | Mobile | Automatically adjust site to mobile phones**.

If things go completely awry, you will be able to delete the site and start again. In that case, choose **More Actions | Manage Site| Delete Site**.

## Hints on Google Sites

Here is one way to set up your Google Site.

- Use Atom and MakeHtml, or StackEdit, or some other set of tools, to convert your markdown to HTML.
  - StackEdit: (# menu | Export to Disk | As markdown).
- Open the HTML in a text editor such as Geany, NotePad++, CodeAnywhere, nano or Visual Studio. (Wordpad might also work.)
- Block Copy the HTML to the clipboard (Ctrl-C).
- Open Your Google Site page. Go into edit mode.
- Click the little HTML symbol on the top of the page at the right.
- Delete any and all HTML shown in the HTML editor.
- Paste in your HTML (Ctrl-V).
- Save your work.

## Turn it In

The primary content of the assignment, such as the various folders and documents, will appear automatically in my Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Evernote accounts. Thus there is nothing you absolutely must turn in to canvas other than an acknowledgement that you have completed the assignment. To make the acknowledgement, simply press the submit button in Canvas! Having said this, you might also consider pasting the Online Presence document you put in your Google folder into the Text page of Canvas. On that page, I believe, links are **live** so that I can just click on them.

Though it may be in need of an update, see the following for more information on working with Google Drive:
