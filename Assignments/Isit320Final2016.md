## Overview

A description of the final for Isit320, Fall, 2016.

## Basics

- Bring DataMaster to the furthest point you can without including known bugs.
- Bring DataHunter (the game) to the furthest point you can without including known bugs
- Run both programs on EC2 with systemd so that they stay up after you close the SSH connection.
  - DataMaster on port 30026
  - DataHunter on port 30025

## Turn it in

- About 70% percent of your grade will involve creating bug free programs at mid-term level or higher.
- The remaining 30% of your grade involve implementing the features outlined in the FinalPrep assignments, and in other assignments we have done this quarter.

In short, if you can turn in something that works, that includes what we covered through the midterm, then you will probably pass the course. To get a good grade, you need to complete all the features that we have outlined throughout the assignments in this course. I am particularly interested in seeing that you have followed the following programs:

- DRY: Don't repeat yourself
- SRP: Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle: Open to Extension, closed to modification

I will grade on a curve that is based on the degree of experience that developers brought into the course. It will be easier for developers with less experience to do well in the course. A straight A, however, is reserved for those with experience who have mastered the topics in the course, and particularly the three principles outlined above.

I'll be expecting your final code to be in your repository, on the **master** branch, in two folders:

- DataMaster
- DataHunter

You can tell me about other versions of your code on other branches that may be more advanced, but buggier. Remember, however, when looking at your final code, I'm looking for bug free programs. In this final, at least, fewer features and fewer bugs is better than more features and more bugs. But the more bug free features you can create the better.

**NOTE**: _I'm not looking for release quality software. I won't be trying to break your program. When I say bug free, I mean that I can choose a menu item or hyperlinker, be taken to a feature, and have it work correctly at least the first time I select it._
