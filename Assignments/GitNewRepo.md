# Git New Repo

Use [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) to host a private [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) repository. You have two choices:

    Create a new BitBucket account if you don't have one already
    Use an existing BitBucket account.

In the account, create a new repository. Name your git repository like this, where isit322 should be name of your class:

	isit322_lastname

For instance:

	prog272_calvert
	prog270_calvert
	isit320_calvert
	isit320_calvert

Make sure you give me read/write access to it. Use the send invitation link and use ccalvert as my id.

And most important, include a .gitignore with the following items in it:

	node_modules
	.metadata
	.idea
	Thumbs.db

Please submit the URL of your repository in the Text Entry section of Canvas when you post this assignment. The URL you submit should, in a general way, follow this format:

	git clone git@bitbucket.org:lastname/prog272_lastname.git

You can get the exact phrase to submit by selecting the **Actions | Clone** menu item at the top left of the BitBucket site.

## Summary
