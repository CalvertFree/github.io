Code Academy

First, create an account on [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

After you have set up your account, I want you to complete some 
simple exercises in Code Academy. This should help you recall a few 
basic facts about HTML and JavaScript, in case you need to brush up 
on your skills.

- [Go to Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
- Complete *HTML Basics* and *Build Your own Web Page*
- [Go to JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
- Complete *Getting Started with Programming*

When you are done, submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**,
like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

Needless to say, if you have already completed the assignments, perhaps
in another of my courses, you need only provide a link to your existing
account. Or, if you want to work through them again, create a new
account and start over. 

I don't think you can delete work you have done and reset a course
you have already completed. You can use the left panel to pick a section
you have not done yet, but I don't see a way to completely start over.
