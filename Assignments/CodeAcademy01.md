#Code Academy

The Code Academy web site features interactive lessons on various computer technologies, including JavaScript and HTML. It provides an excellent way for you to brush up on basic skills that we don't have time to cover in class.

To get started, create  an account on [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/). 

**NOTE**: *The name of the site is actually **codecademy**, not **code academy**. In a no doubt futile attempt to preserve what is left of the English language, I nevertheless tend to call it code academy*.

After you have set up your account, I want you to complete some simple exercises in Code Academy. This should help you recall a few basic facts about HTML and JavaScript, in case you need to brush up on your skills.

- [Go to Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
- Complete at least 25% of the skill.
- [Go to JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
- Complete at least 25% of the skill.

##Turn it in

When you are done, submit either a screen shot or a link to your Code Academy **profile page**. Whether you submit a screen shot or a link depends on whether or not you have entirely completed a Code Academy skill. To help you understand what I want, consider the two following concepts:

- Bellevue College Assignments, known as assignments.
- Code Academy Skills, known as skills. 

In this **assignment** we are working on one quarter of the Code Academy JavaScript **skill**. If you have completed only 25% of a skill, then submit a screen shot. In this assignment, I ask for only 25% of a skill to be completed, so most of you will submit a screen shot. If, however, you have completed the entire skill, then submit a link to your profile page. I describe the profile page and the screen shot below.

##Profile Pages and Screen Shots

On Code Academy, I am known as netslayer43536. As a result, a link to my profile page looks like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

If you complete one hundred percent of some skill, then you should submit a link to your profile page. Don't submit a link to any other page on Code Academy. You must submit a link to your profile page or I will kick the assignment back to you.

In July, 2014 CodeAcademy changed their profile pages so that I will not be able to see your progress through a particular skill by looking at your profile page. Their change made it so that I can see only your completed skills on the profile page. If you have not yet completed a particular skill by finishing 100% of the questions, can you please submit a screen shot of the skills you have completed. It will probably look something like this:

## All Done

If you have already completed the assignments, perhaps in another of my courses, you need only provide a link to your existing profile page. If you want to work through a skill again, create a new account and start over.  I don't think you can delete work you have done and reset a course you have already completed. You can use the left panel to pick a section you have not done yet, but I don't see a way to completely start over.
