#Code Academy

The Code Academy web site features interactive lessons on various computer technologies, including JavaScript and HTML. It provides an excellent way for you to brush up on basic skills that we don't have time to cover in class.

To get started, create  an account on [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/). 

**NOTE**: *The name of the site is actually **codecademy**, not **code academy**. In a no doubt futile attempt to preserve what is left of the English language, I nevertheless tend to call it code academy*.

After you have set up your account, I want you to complete some simple exercises in Code Academy. This should help you recall a few basic facts about HTML and JavaScript, in case you need to brush up on your skills.

- [Go to Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
- Complete at least 25% of the track.
- [Go to JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
- Complete at least 25% of the track.

When you are done, submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**,
like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

**Please note**: *If you have completed 100% of a skill on Code Academy, you should provide a link to your profile page. That's one hundred percent of the CodeAcademy skill, not 100% of a particular assignment. When you submit a completed skill, don't just link to some random page on CodeAcademy. The assignment can be graded only if you turn in a link to your profile page!*

**NOTE**: *In July, 2014 CodeAcademy changed their profile pages so that I will not be able to see your progress through a particular skill by looking at your profile page. Their change made it so that I can see only your completed skills on the profile page. If you have not yet completed a particular skill by finishing 100% of the questions, can you please submit a screen shot of the skills you have completed. It will probably look something like this:*

Needless to say, if you have already completed the assignments, perhaps in another of my courses, you need only provide a link to your existing profile page. Or, if you want to work through them again, create a new account and start over.  I don't think you can delete work you have done and reset a course you have already completed. You can use the left panel to pick a section you have not done yet, but I don't see a way to completely start over.
