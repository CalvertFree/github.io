<h4 id="your-google-account">Your Google Account</h4>
<p>An Android device is fairly powerful in and of itself, but the real strength of the device becomes apparent once you have logged on to your Google account.</p>
<h4 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h4>
<p>You can edit documents on your google device. Provide a screen shot of you editing a document from your Prog270 Google Drive folder on your mobile device.</p>
<h4 id="twitter">Twitter</h4>
<p>Create tweet on your mobile device, and take a picture of the screen just before you submit it.</p>
<h4 id="evernote">Evernote</h4>
<p>While on your mobile device, create a note in Evernote and take screen shot of it while you are editing it.</p>
<h4 id="google">Google+</h4>
<p>Make a post in Google+ and provide a screen shot of your work in Google+</p>
<h4 id="upload-screenshots">Upload Screenshots</h4>
<p>You can <strong>share</strong> the screen shots you created to both Google Drive and DropBox. It may take a moment for you to figure out how to <strong>share</strong> a photo, but if you look in the menu system, you will see that the option is available.</p>

<p>Here is where you can find assignments and content that you can explore at home, outside of class.</p>
<h3 id="watch-videos">Watch Videos</h3>
<p>There will be several videos showing how to use mobile devices. The first one is here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/uHCpLgpk4T0">Android and Google Documents</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Details on this assignment to follow.</p>
<h3 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h3>
<p>Check the due date of this assignment in Canvas.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/3016277">Assignment page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Create a Bootstrap document that uses the images you created in class. Include text that describes each of the images.</p>
<p>Include your bitmaps of working in our Android Asus Memo Device in this project and check it in. I want you to link to your files stored in Google Drive directly. If you create a public folder in Google Drive, then you can put your images there and reference them in your HTML.</p>
<p>Here is a sample URL:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://googledrive.com/host/0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00/ScreenShot01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ScreenShot01.jpg&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you go to Google Docs, and you choose to share your folder, you can retrieve the URL for the folder. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00&amp;usp=sharing</code></pre>
<p>Notie that the ID shown here is the next to last field of the URL for the screenshot:</p>
<pre><code>https://googledrive.com/host/ID OF DRIVE/ScreenShotName.jpg</code></pre>
<p>
And here is an actual image:

Download the starter source which is linked from the in Canvas. There is an updated copy of the source available, but it differs from the first version in only very small ways. In particular, the menu for the two supplimental pages has been updated to match the menu on the first page.
</p>

<p><a href="https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/3016277">Assignment page</a></p>
<h4 id="the-home-page">The Home Page</h4>
<p>At the top of the home page, you should create a table or list showing the key features of our Android device. List, for instance, the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amount of memory it has on the hard drive</li>
<li>The amount of RAM it has</li>
<li>Which processor it uses</li>
<li>The size of the screen</li>
<li>The version of Android that it runs</li>
<li>Other details such as ports and buttons</li>
<li>The cost, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the home page, notice that there are three bitmaps arranged in a simple pattern:</p>
<pre><code>   [Pix1]
[Pix2] 
   [Pix3]</code></pre>
<p>You should preserve this pattern in your version of the app. I have placed a screen shot of our Android device in Pix1. You should put pictures of your Android in positions for Pix2 and Pix3, which are shown below in green and blue. Whether you replace Pix1 with one of your own is up to you.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/AndroidPixs01.png" alt="Alternate Images" /><figcaption>Alternate Images</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You should put text describing your pictures next to the pictures themselves. Which pictures you put where are up to you. However, some screenshots that would be good candidates for this page would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The WiFi Settings page</li>
<li>The Applications Page</li>
<li>The Widgets Page</li>
<li>The About Tablet | Status Page</li>
<li>The Google Drive Page</li>
<li>A SkyDrive Page</li>
<li>AirDroid</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more.</p>
<p>There are two more pages in the web application. Right now one is called <strong>Pictures</strong> and the other <strong>About</strong>. You should put more information about your Android device on these pages. There need be only one picture of the device on each page. You might, for instance, create two pages similar to these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 1: The Google Music Player. Describe and show getting music from the play store and playing it in the music player</li>
<li>Page 2: Google Books. Describe and show getting books from the play store and viewing them in Google Books.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other topics might include Vinio and Overdrive, or any other apps or features that interest you. Be creative, use your imagination. Or just do a good workman like job of describing some feature of the Android.</p>
<h3 id="edit-data-on-mobile-device">Edit data on mobile device</h3>
<p>Provide a screen shot of you editing data from your CloudNine Mongo Db app on your mobile device.</p>
