<h4 id="your-google-account">Your Google Account</h4>
<p>An Android device is fairly powerful in and of itself, but the real strength of the device becomes apparent once you have logged on to your Google account.</p>
<h4 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h4>
<p>You can edit documents on your google device. Provide a screen shot of you editing a document from your Prog270 Google Drive folder on your mobile device.</p>
<h4 id="twitter">Twitter</h4>
<p>Create tweet on your mobile device, and take a picture of the screen just before you submit it.</p>

<p>While on your mobile device, create a note in Evernote and take screen shot of it while you are editing it.</p>

</ul>
<p>Create a Bootstrap document that uses the images you created in class. Include text that describes each of the images.</p>
<p>Include your bitmaps of working in Android Memo in this project and check it in. I want you to link to your files stored in Google Drive directly. If you create a public folder in Google Drive, then you can put your images there and reference them in your HTML.</p>
<p>Here is a sample URL:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://googledrive.com/host/0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00/ScreenShot01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ScreenShot01.jpg&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you go to Google Docs, and you choose to share your folder, you can retrieve the URL for the folder. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00&amp;usp=sharing</code></pre>
<p>Notie that the ID shown here is the next to last field of the URL for the screenshot:</p>
<pre><code>https://googledrive.com/host/ID OF DRIVE/ScreenShotName.jpg</code></pre>
<p>
And here is the actual image:
