## Prog 270 - Week 01 - Fall - 2016

Each week we have two sessions, on Monday and Wednesdays, in N252. Each week I will try to prepare a single document like this one that covers our class activities. For instance,
this document outlines what we will cover this week in class, and online.

- [Monday](#monday)
- [Wednesday](#Wednesday)

This is the only copy of these notes. Occasionally, I will update these notes during the course of the week. In those cases, I will usually make an announcement in Canvas. It is your obligation to look for those announcements, and to respond to them as appropriate. As a result, I would strongly suggest that you make a daily habit
of checking the announcements and discussions in Canvas.

Since these documents may change at any time, I suggest you view them online rather than trying to print them and take them with you.

## Monday Jan 4 {#monday}

Here are the primary goals we have set for this week:

- Provide a course overview,

## Wednesday {#wednesday}

This week you should spend time exploring Canvas, exploring the [Elvenware](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie) site, and practicing creating documents in Google Drive.

If you have extra time, I would recommend watching at least some of
the very lengthy key note for Google IO 2015. It will help you
understand the culture of one of the largest players in the world of
mobile devices and cloud computing:
