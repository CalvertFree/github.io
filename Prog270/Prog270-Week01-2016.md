# Prog 270 - Week 01 - Fall - 2016

Each week we have two sessions, on Monday and Wednesday, in N252\. I will try to prepare a single document like this one that outlines the main topics covered each week. For instance, this document outlines what we will cover this week in class, and online.

- [Monday](#monday)
- [Wednesday](#Wednesday)

This is the only copy of these notes. Occasionally, I will update these notes during the course of the week. In those cases, I will usually make an announcement in Canvas. It is your obligation to look for those announcements, and to respond to them as appropriate. As a result, I would strongly suggest that you make a daily habit of checking the announcements and discussions in Canvas.

Since these documents may change at any time, I suggest you view them online rather than trying to print them and take them with you. It is also a good idea to press F5 to update the document at least once a day. That way you can be sure you are seeing the latest version.

# Install Pristine Lubuntu into VirtualBox {#virtualbox-lubuntu}

In this class we use a copy of Lubuntu running in Virtual Box. The first step is to download the custom Lubuntu OVA VirtualBox VM File from Google Drive. This is a copy of the Linux Lubuntu desktop specially prepared for this course. Here is a link to the approximately 3.0 GB download:

- <http://bit.ly/pristine-lubuntu-2016-sept-02>

Once the OVA file is downloaded, consider moving it to some save location such as your **Documents/Data** directory. You can simply click on the OVA file to load it in VirtualBox. When doing so, select the option that reads something like **re-initialize Mac address**.

If you get a warning about USB drivers, this usually means that the Virtual Box virtual extensions are not installed. This could be due to a mistake by the Bellevue College IS department. If you have the rights, install them from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), using the Virtual Box **Preferences** menu. (Or just double click on the download). Otherwise, you can go to **Settings | USB** for your VM and turn USB off for now.

Here is a somewhat dated link to a more detailed description of what to do with the OVA file once you download it:

If you need to install VirtualBox on your laptop, here is a description of how to proceed:
