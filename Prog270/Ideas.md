- ToDo Lists
- AWS
- Google Drive
- One Drive
- StackEdit

## StackEdit
A key feature of Stack Edit is the ability to save the documents and links you create to a JSON file that you can then open in another browser.

I keep my latest copy of this file on Google Drive.

##ToDo Lists

We need to find the ToDo List that bests suits us. As a result, we might open three different accounts. Track one area of life in one account, another in the second, and a third area in a third account. For instance:

- HabitRpg: School
- Any.do: Work
- Wunderlist: Home
- Google: Hobbies

##Make Videos

Show people how to make videos and upload to YouTube.

##FileSystems

- Don't use a thumb drive for anything but backups
- Store your data in the cloud
- Don't put spaces in your path
- Use your home directory or great a library
