This is an in class exercise.

- Create an account
- Create a database
- Create a collection
- Put some data in the collection

Here is some sample data

```
{
	"firstName": "George",
	"lastName": "Washington"
}
```



###Genymotion

[Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/) has prebuilt AndroidX86 VMs 
and includes a nice Nexus emulator. Using Genymotion is optional, 
but useful. There is custom Windows install for Genymtion, but the 
VMs they create install automatically into VirtualBox. (Get the install
that does not include VirtualBox, as you have that installed already.)

Like Android 4.3, this might not work on all systems. And of course,
it probably won't install into N252 machines, since it requires 
Admin priviliges to do the install.
