<p>It is time for the midterm.</p>
<h2 id="validate-your-code">Validate your Code</h2>
<p>Go to this address: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a></p>
<p>Paste in the URL of your index.html page. You should be able to see errors in your HTML that cloud nine and other editors won't see. You should ignore errors about ng-resource or any other attribute that starts with ng.</p>
<h3 id="midterm-part-i">Midterm Part I</h3>
<p>Most of this will be the same as before, only this time it counts for one third of your grade.</p>
<p>You have three tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a bootstrap based set of at least four HTML pages with images that run on Cloud 9 and Linux.</li>
<li>On one of the pages add in JavaScript that accesses your Mongo Lab database and JavaScript that shows an animated image.</li>
<li>Create a screen shot of your program running on both:
<ul>
<li>Your phone or tablet if you have one</li>
<li>In Android X86 running VirtualBox</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't have a phone, you won't lose points for not submitting that screen shot. If you can show me it running on your phone, but can't get VBox and AndroidX86 running, then the phone screen shot is much better than nothing. Everyone should, however, be able to get at least AndroidX86 2.3 running somewhere.</p>
<p>The content of your bootstrap HTML files is up to you. However, I will be grading you on your ability to create something reasonably coherent. Here is what I'm looking for. I want to see that you understand how to use these tools to put information in the cloud that can viewed on a mobile device. Getting a web page up and running is good, but I want to see that you have enough control over that page to put real content and real pictures in it. This means that I want to see at least a paragraph or two of text, and some accompanying images.</p>
<p>You could, for instance, have pages built around one of the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An historical event</li>
<li>A popular star</li>
<li>A fictional character like Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland or David Copperfield</li>
<li>Pictures and descriptions of your favorite place or hobby</li>
<li>The planets in our solar system</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details on this test will follow. This is just enough to let you understand what will be expected of you.</p>
<h3 id="midterm-part-ii">Midterm Part II</h3>
<p>There will be a quiz in which you will be expected to answer some questions about Android. You will be able to answer the questions by using your Android X86 emulator.</p>
<p>I will post a link to the quiz when it is ready.</p>
