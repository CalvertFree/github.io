<p>On Tuesday, I would like to dig more into the Android hardware, and perhaps that would be the best place to explore in depth.</p>

<p>I want to talk about Android hardware on Tuesday, and probably the best idea is to wait for that date. Then I will have time to lay out all the options. However, the Nexus/Galaxy/top of the line Asus tablets are certainly all good choices in most cases.</p>

<p>The primary job this week will be to complete the <a href="https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/2877658">MarkDown Assignment</a>. The assignment itself can be found inside Canvas, and is linked from the modules area. On Google Drive I have prepared <a href="http://bit.ly/1cm36qb">a document</a> which both describes the assignment, and also provides a mini-lecture on the subject of markdown itself. I have also included a very short, silent <a href="http://youtu.be/YZUruYmEFG0">video</a> that will help you get an overview of the concepts you need to master to complete the assignment.</p>
<h4 id="some-links">Some Links</h4>
<p>None of these links are particularly important at this moment, but I find all of them interesting.</p>

<p>Goal: Become familiar with the key Mobile platforms, hardware, and functionality</p>
