Google Site Insert HTML
-----------------------

To insert HTML into a page on Google Sites:

* First put your page in edit mode
* Then go to the top of the page where you have icons for editing your content
* Click the little HTML icon
* Paste in your text and click the Update button. 

Markdown Tips
------------

Here is how to put text between images in a markdown document. Notice
that there is an empty line between each of these elements:

Text 1

```
	[Text](ImageURL)
```

Text 2

```
	[Text](ImageURL)
```

Text 3

```
	[Text](ImageURL)
```

Here is an example page:

![Example page](https://sites.google.com/site/elvenware/home/prog270/testimagepage)

Here is how to add titles to images in markdown:

![alt](url "title")

Reference:

This is still not the caption, but when you hover your mouse 
over the picture, the "title" will pop up.
