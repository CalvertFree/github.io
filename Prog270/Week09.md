###In Class Assignment

Boot your mobile device and

- Sign in to the mobile device you are given as class starts
- Install Google Drive, Google+, Twitter, Evernote and optionally DropBox
- Take screen shots of your work in all the apps as described below
- Take a screenshot of your Settings | Accounts page.
- Put the screen shots in your folder on Google Drive

When you are done, submit a link to your folder.

####Your Google Account

An Android device is fairly powerful in and of itself,
but the real strength of the device becomes apparent
once you have logged on to your Google account.

####Google Drive

You can edit documents on your google device. Provide
a screen shot of you editing a document from your Prog270
Google Drive folder on your mobile device.

####Twitter

Create tweet on your mobile device, and take a picture
of the screen just before you submit it.

####Evernote

While on your mobile device, create a note in Evernote
and take screen shot of it while you are editing it.

####Google+

Make a post in Google+ and provide a screen shot of 
your work in Google+

####Upload Screenshots

You can **share** the screen shots you created to
both Google Drive and DropBox. It may take a moment
for you to figure out how to **share** a photo, but
if you look in the menu system, you will see that
the option is available.

Details on this assignment to follow.

###Bootstrap

Check the due date of this assignment in Canvas.

- [Assignment page](https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/3016277)

Create a Bootstrap document that uses the images you
created in class. Include text that describes each of 
the images.

Include your bitmaps of working in Android Memo in this project and 
check it in. I want you to link to your files stored in Google Drive 
directly. If you create a public folder in Google Drive, then you 
can put your images there and reference them in your HTML.

Here is a sample URL:

	<img src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00/ScreenShot01.jpg" alt="ScreenShot01.jpg" />

If you go to Google Docs, and you choose to share your folder, you can retrieve
the URL for the folder. It looks like this:

	https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00&usp=sharing

Notie that the ID shown here is the next to last field of the URL for
the screenshot:

	https://googledrive.com/host/ID OF DRIVE/ScreenShotName.jpg

<p>And here is the actual image:</p>
