but the real strength of the device becomes apparent
once you have logged on to your Google account.

####Google Drive

You can edit documents on your google device. Provide
a screen shot of you editing a document from your Prog270
Google Drive folder on your mobile device.

####Twitter

Create tweet on your mobile device, and take a picture
of the screen just before you submit it.

####Evernote

While on your mobile device, create a note in Evernote
and take screen shot of it while you are editing it.

####Google+

Make a post in Google+ and provide a screen shot of 
your work in Google+

####Upload Screenshots

You can **share** the screen shots you created to
both Google Drive and DropBox. It may take a moment
for you to figure out how to **share** a photo, but
if you look in the menu system, you will see that
the option is available.
