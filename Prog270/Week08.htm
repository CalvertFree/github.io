<h3 id="genymotion">Genymotion</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a> has prebuilt AndroidX86 VMs and includes a nice Nexus emulator. Using Genymotion is optional, but useful. There is custom Windows install for Genymtion, but the VMs they create install automatically into VirtualBox. (Get the install that does not include VirtualBox, as you have that installed already.)</p>
<p>Like Android 4.3, this might not work on all systems. And of course, it probably won't install into N252 machines, since it requires Admin priviliges to do the install.</p>

<h3 id="lastpass">Asignment01-LastPass</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create an account on LastPass. Send me a screen shot of your recently used list, showing that you have used Lastpass to sign in to at least three accounts, including your BC mail. You may use a bitmap editor to blank out the email for all but your BC mail account.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Place your screen shot an Week08-LastPass folder in your repository and submit the URL of your repository.</p>
<p>Terrence added these helpful notes in the discussion area:</p>
<p>Here are the detailed steps. Folks who have installed the plug-in can probably duplicate this and get the desired results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign into LastPass from the browser plug-in.</li>
<li>Click the LastPass icon on the browser (see screen shot)</li>
<li>fill in the applicable fields, and click Login.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/LastPass02.png" alt="Detail of Lastpass icon" /><figcaption>Detail of Lastpass icon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You should now be signed in to LastPass and the icon changed color from black to red to indicate this. (The icon is black when you are not signed in.)</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log onto a site in your vault by using LastPass.</li>
<li>Click the icon again, click Sites, and click a listed site to automatically log on to it.</li>
<li>Open your LastPass vault.</li>
<li>Click the icon again, and click My LastPass Vault.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will probably see a default folder named &quot;(none)&quot; that lists the sites you added to LastPass. You should now also see a &quot;recently used&quot; folder above this that shows the last sites you visited.</p>
<h3 id="gitPractice">Git Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, create a folder in your repository called <strong>Week08-GitPractice</strong></li>
<li>Add two files called
<ul>
<li><strong>Test01.md</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test02.md</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a folder called <strong>images</strong></li>
<li>Go to GitHub for Windows and navigate to your repository</li>
<li>Step01. Before you check in your new code, take a screenshot of GitHub for windows and put it in your images folder</li>
<li>Check in your code</li>
<li>Open up Cloud Nine</li>
<li>Pull down your latest additions to Git</li>
<li>Take a screeshot and put it in your images folder</li>
<li>Open Lubuntu</li>
<li>Pull down your code and take a screen shot of it in Lubuntu</li>
<li>In cloud nine, using the terminal window, navigate to your Week08-GitPractice and issue this command: <strong>ls -la &gt; CloudNine.txt</strong></li>
<li>Check in and push your code in Cloud Nine</li>
<li>Pull your code in Lubuntu</li>
<li>In Lubuntu navigate to your Week08-GitPracticeFolder and issue this command: <strong>ls -la &gt; Lubuntu.txt</strong></li>
<li>Checkin and push your code from Lubuntu</li>
<li>Pull your code in Windows.</li>
<li>Navigate to your Week08-GitPractice folder and at the command line issue this command: <strong>dir /od &gt; Windows.txt</strong></li>
<li>Checkin and push your code and submit your Git URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the images below, right click and pick &quot;open image in new tab&quot; to see a full sized image.</p>

<h3 id="mongo">MongoDb</h3>
<p>This is your main assignment. It is similar to the midterm, only this time the data will be updatable.</p>
<p>If you have not done so already:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://mongolab.com/">https://mongolab.com/</a></li>
<li>Create an account</li>
<li>Create a database</li>
<li>Create a collection</li>
<li>Put some data in the collection</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is some sample data</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;A&quot;,
    &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;B&quot;,
    &quot;address&quot;: &quot;C&quot;,
    &quot;city&quot;: &quot;D&quot;,
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;E&quot;,
    &quot;zip&quot;: &quot;F&quot;,
    &quot;phoneHome&quot;: &quot;G&quot;,
    &quot;phoneMobile&quot;: &quot;H&quot;,
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;I&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>Modify the program linked from the assignment page on Canvas so that you can connect to your data in your database. Add at least three records to your database.</p>
<p>Check in your code in a folder of your repository called Week08-Mongo. Include a screenshot of your collection in MongoLab site.</p>
<p>I tried to make it easier to fix up database name and collection. See MondoData.js:</p>
<pre><code>.constant(&#39;CONFIG&#39;, {
    DB_NAME: &#39;elvenlab01&#39;,
    COLLECTION: &#39;address&#39;,
    API_KEY: &#39;qfSxFoUGHBA1EuUlqhux_op2fy6oF_wy&#39;
})</code></pre>
<p>For instane, if your database was called <strong>lucydatabase</strong>, and your collection was called <strong>lucydata</strong> and your API_KEY was <strong>qmykey1</strong>, then you would change the above code to read like this:</p>
<pre><code>.constant(&#39;CONFIG&#39;, {
    DB_NAME: &#39;lucydatabase&#39;,
    COLLECTION: &#39;lucydata&#39;,
    API_KEY: &#39;qmykey1&#39;
})</code></pre>
<p>I also want you to create one page that links to the Pictures menu item that is similar to the custom page you created for the midterm. It should, for instance, contain custom text and pictures.</p>
<p>You should also modify the About the page so that it is attactive and contains reasonable data, rather than the default data that I have included in the sample about page provided with the starter code.</p>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect to your own database using your own key</li>
<li>Use your own data. Make sure you can add, delete and modify records</li>
<li>Follow the format (firstName, lastName, address, etc) outlined above.</li>
<li>Create a customer <strong>Pictures</strong> page with text and images</li>
<li>Modify the about page.</li>
<li>In your repository, include screenshots showing your application running in Cloud Nine and Lubuntu</li>
<li>Check your work into your repository</li>
</ul>
<p>I provide some default images for the &quot;carousel&quot; at the top of the main page. You can use those images or create different images.</p>
<p>Don't forget to ask questions in the discussion area.</p>
