It is time for the midterm. Most of this will be the same as before,
only this time it counts for one third of your grade.

You have three tasks:

- Create a bootstrap based set of HTML pages with images that run
on Cloud 9 and Linux.
- Add in JavaScript that accesses your Mongo Lab database and JavaScript
that shows an animated image.
- Create a screen shot of your program running on both:
	- Your phone or tablet if you have one
	- In Android X86 running VirtualBox 

If you don't have a phone, you won't loose points for not submitting 
that screen shot. If you can show me it running on your phone,
but can't get VBox and AndroidX86 running, then the phone screen shot
is much better than nothing. Everyone should, however, be able to get
at least AndroidX86 2.3 running somewhere. 

The content of your bootstrap HTML files is up to you. However, I will
be grading you on your ability to create something reasonably coherent.
Here is what I'm looking for. I want to see that you understand how to
use these tools to put information in the cloud that can viewed on a
mobile device. Getting a web page up and running is good, but I want
to see that you have enough control over that page to put real content
and real pictures in it. This means that I want to see at least a 
paragraph or two of text, and some accompanying images.

You could, for instance, have pages built around one of the following
themes:

- An historical event
- A popular star
- A fictional character like Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland or David Copperfield
- Pictures and descriptions of your favorite place or hobby
- The planets in our solar system

Further details on this test will follow. This is just enough to let you 
understand what will be expected of you.
