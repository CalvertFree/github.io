Picking a Tablet
----------------

On Tuesday, I would like to dig more into the Android hardware, and 
perhaps that would be the best place to explore in depth.

I want to talk about Android hardware on Tuesday, and probably the 
best idea is to wait for that date. Then I will have time to lay out 
all the options. However, the Nexus/Galaxy/top of the line Asus 
tablets are certainly all good choices in most cases.

This section will be updated later in the week, it is for work you do
after our class on Tuesday. Remember, this is hybrid class, so part
of your assignment is to come to class, but part of it is to follow
the additional information I provide here.

####Some Links

None of these links are particularly important at this moment, but I find
all of them interesting.
