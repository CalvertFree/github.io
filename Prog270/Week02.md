Picking a Tablet
----------------

- Do you want a phone or a tablet?
- Do you have to have cellular data?
- Do you want a phone + cellular data
- Or just cellular data
- Or is just wi-fi enough? This means you can only connect when near a wifi hub.
- Assuming you want a tablet with just wifi, which ones are best?
- Do you want 7 or 10 inch screen?
- Do you want 16GB or 32GB?



On Tuesday, I would like to dig more into the Android hardware, and perhaps that would be the best place to explore in depth. 

One question to consider, do you want a phone? If not, then it might be simplest to just get a tablet. They are bigger and and tend to be less expensive, and of course you don't need the cellular monthly fee to run a tablet, as you can just connect to the internet over a wifi network. There are, however, tablets that allow you to connect to cellular data, and that is usually cheaper than having a phone that features cellular data.

So assuming you want a tablet, and you don't want cellular data, what are the best tablets? Well, that depends on a few other criteria. For instance, do you want a 7 or 10 inch tablet?

The 7 inch tablets are usually cheaper. If that is what you want, then the Nexus, would have to be near the top of the list, along with the Samsung Galaxy Note or Tab.

There is also a 32 GB version of the Nexus. 

These kinds of decisions are hard to make, but going with either the Nexus or the Galaxy is likely to be a good choice. Asus also has some nice offerings in this line. 

I want to talk about Android hardware on Tuesday, and probably the best idea is to wait for that date. Then I will have time to lay out all the options. However, the Nexus/Galaxy/top of the line Asus tablets are certainly all good choices in most cases.

One big thing to keep in mind: I can't buy all the different devices and test them myself. I'm very happy with my Galaxy S4, which is pricey. My Samsung Galaxy Tabs are not as powerful as the Note, but I have liked them.
