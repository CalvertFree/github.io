## Coverage

Run coverage at least once on your project. Go ahead and tweak .gitignore if necessary and check in your coverage directory. I'll look for it when grading.

Add **coverage** to **.eslintignore**. We don't need to run eslint on the files you generate when you run coverage.

## Testing

Get at least 20 test to pass.

## Turn it in

- prettier should pass
- eslint . should pass
- coverage
  - I don't really care what percentage of coverage you have.
  - In your README.md file, list the three files you created with the highest coverage.
  - Extra credit, get 90% coverage on all your files.
