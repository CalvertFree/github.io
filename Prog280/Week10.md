Prog 280 Week 10
================

Our goals for this week:

- Putty, Filezilla, Git, EC2 and Pageant.
- Compare files with Meld

## AwsBasicS3

InSync is a Google Drive client for Linux. It is well done, but costs $15
for a lifetime access for version 1.0. There is a fifteen day trial, which
will get us through the end of the quarter. If you install via the link 
below, then both you and I will get 15 extra day for our trial.
