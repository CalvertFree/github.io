## Prog 272 Week 01, 2016

Some notes to help us get started during Week01, spring, 2016.

## Getting Started

Our job on this first day will be to get an overview of the subjects to be
covered in this class. You will have a few assignments this week:

1.  Write an Introduction in the discussion area
1.  Register for some online sites and create an online presence document.
1. Get Pristine Lubuntu up and running VirtualBox.

And here is some optional reading:

1.  Read [Crockford on JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html).
1.  Using Books 24X7, review Chapter Three from [Pro JavaScript by Zakas](http://library.books24x7.com.ezproxy.bellevuecollege.edu/toc.aspx?bookid=44953)

I'm not asking you to read every page of Chapter Three from Zakas'
book. You should however, become familiar with the material it covers.
