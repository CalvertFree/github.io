Getting Started
---------------

Our job on this first day will be to get an overview of the subjects to be
covered in this class. You will have a few assignments:

1.  Write an Introduction in the discussion area
2.  Take a short quiz describing your computer setup
3.  Register for some online sites and create an online presence document.
4.  Read [Crockford on JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html).
5.  Using Books 24X7, review Chapter Three from [Pro JavaScript by Zakas](http://library.books24x7.com.ezproxy.bellevuecollege.edu/toc.aspx?bookid=44953)

I'm not asking you to read every page of Chapter Three from Zakas' 
book. You should however, become familiar with the matarial it covers,
and be prepared to answer questions from an open book quiz on its 
primary themes.
