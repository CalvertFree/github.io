<article><p>This page uses a single custom CSS file with media queries to change 
	it's appearance as it loads on different devices. Like the main page, this page 
	has a <strong>header</strong>, <strong>nav</strong>, <strong>article</strong> and 
	<strong>footer</strong>.</p>

	<p>The CSS file uses media queries to determine the current width of the 
	browser. It then adjusts the arrangements of HTML elements to better suit 
	the new dimensions of the browser.</p>

	<p>Note that that the menu is retractable, so that it can be moved out of 
	the way. To some degree, the menu will hide or restore itself automatically 
	as you resize the window. As I've implemented it, this feature does not 
	currently work properly after the user has has taken over control of the 
	menu.</p>
