## Overview

We automatically run JavaScript in the included file.

## Details

We include a JS file:

```html
<script src="../Scripts/AutoRun.js" type="text/javascript"\>\</script>
```

And inside it we execute JavaScript:

```javascript
document.write("\<p\>JavaScript text run automatically\</p\>");
```

The point is that arbitrary JavaScript is run without us ever explicitly
calling it. This can be useful or dangerous, depending on how it is
used.
