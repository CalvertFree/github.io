# Schedule

Here is the proposed schedule for our course.

## Downloads

Click the link below and click through until the download begins. After it ends, double click on the OVA file to load it in VirtualBox.

You will be given a chance to reset the MAC address. Be sure you select this option. It may work one time if you do not do this, but you are likely to hit problems in the future. Please **reset the MAC address**.

If you forgot to reset the MAC address, let me know, and I will show you how to go to **Settings | Network | Advanced** to reset the MAC after the install. The VM must be stopped while you perform this operation.
