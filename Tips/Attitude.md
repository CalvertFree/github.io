If we want to achieve your goals, work on maintaining a positive attitude. There will always be problems any place you work. Both the people around you, and you yourself, will always have flaws and make mistakes. The key to success is to know this, accept it, and rise above it. Contribute what you can with enthusiasm and open cooperation. Accept the bad stuff. You will find it manifests itself both in your own actions and in the actions of your fellow employees and managers. The bad stuff is simply part of the price of earning a living and working with others.

Develop a strong, fighting attitude. Be tough and don't give up. You may have reasonably good technical skills, but you will still have to work on polishing and refining them. Tech is not easy, and we have to give 100% if we want to have real success.
