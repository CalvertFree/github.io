## Lots of Links

I tend to publish a lot of links in assignments and in overview documents. It is generally not necessary to read all the content referenced by these links, however  it is usually a good idea to click on most of these links and at least scan the first few paragraphs, just to make sure you understanding what information is available.

A rather extreme case is the Week01 overview:
Week01 (Links to an external site.)

At the very top, it links to the Isit320 Resources page:
Isit320 Resources (Links to an external site.)

Some of these links go to very long, and often not particularly well organized, documents. Nevertheless, it is nice to at least know that there is an Elvenware page that discusses Git, and to note that it links to other valuable resources.

We don't have a book, so you have no reading to do each week. But that doesn't mean you are completely off the hook in terms of doing a little reading outside of class. I'm not saying you should dedicate five or six hours to trying to read everything I link to, but dedicating 20 or 30 minutes to exploring some of the links is likely to be valuable.

For instance, every once in a while, around week five or six, in the discussion area, someone will suddenly discover the Git book. "'Look what I found', they say. 'A free online book about git.'" But if they had spent two minutes with the Git page on Elvenware, they would have known about the book from week one.

This is far from a perfect system, and you are not graded on the number of links you explore. But I do put them there in the hopes that they will help you succeed.
