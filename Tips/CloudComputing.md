## Cloud Computing

If you have not done so already, it is time for you to **move nearly all your documents and code into the cloud**. We generally access information on multiple machines, from desktops to laptops to mobile devices. If we want access to our information from all our devices, then it is usually simplest to store it in the cloud.

You should also know how to use online resources to solve problems. If you want to work with computers, then it is likely that nearly every day you will encounter problems for which there is no obvious solutions. As a result, you have to **learn how to use search engines and discussion areas** to find the answer to unexpected problems. There will be many unexpected problems.
