<p>We are going to continue working with our CanvasGrid projects from the Midterm. The overall goal this week is to start moving all your data, and at least some of your documents, into CouchDb.</p>
<p>You can continue to store some, or even a majority, of your documents and data in subdirectories of your node server. Your goal will be to start moving at least some pieces of your project into a database.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Give you database a unique name that includes your last name. For instance prog282_calvert. Database names should be all small letters, so use an underscore (or dash if it works).</p>
<p>CouchDb stores JSON natively. So anything that you have been sending back and forth from the server using JSON is a likely candidate to move into CouchDb. You can also store HTML, CSS and bitmaps in CouchDb as attachments.</p>
<p>Demos showing how to read and write JSON to CouchDB:</p>
<ul>
<li>JsObjects/Data/CouchDb08</li>
<li>JsObjects/Data/CouchDb09</li>
<li>JsObjects/Data/CouchDb10</li>
</ul>
<p>Demos showing how to read and write attachments, and some advanced error handling:</p>
<ul>
<li>JsObjects/Data/CouchDb11</li>
<li>JSoBjects/Data/CouchDb12</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific goals that you want to achieve for Week08:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the grid from CouchDb</li>
<li>Read (and optionally write) statistics associated with your NPCs from CouchDb</li>
<li>When you encounter an NPC, query CouchDb so you can read and display HTML associated with the NPC</li>
<li>Work on Error Handling. When errors occur in Node, try to bubble them up to the Client HTML.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are creating Document centric projects that are focused mostly on working with HTML, then you should focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing entire HTML files, and partial HTML files in CouchDb</li>
<li>Using Ajax to call into Express, retrieve the HTML, and display it in your files</li>
<li>See if you can do a little templating with Handlebars</li>
<li>Create nice effects with CSS and jQuery</li>
<li>Focus on the CouchDb11 and CouchDb12 examples</li>
</ul>
<p>We have no class on Tuesday. Take some time off, but also check for updates. It is your responsibility to check for updates or clarifications to this assignment. I suggest checking every day, but if that is not practical, check when you can. Saying: &quot;I never saw the update is not enough.&quot;</p>
<p>More details coming soon...</p>
