Week09-Assignment
=================

Create an [express](http://expressjs.com/) generated application that 
uses [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Stylus](). Useful information
can be found on the [Week09-Overview](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/books/CloudNotes/Prog282/Week09.html) page.

It must have a main jade template madke from **layout.jade** and 
**index.jade.** The following pages should also be defined, and 
should use layout.jade:

- page01.jade
- page02.jade
- page03.jade
- page04.jade

There should be links to all these secondary pages from the main page.
They should include a common **nav** section that is defined in 
**layout.jade**.

Also include a page called **game.html** that contains the current state
of your game or class project. You do not need to include the sign in
page. You can just go directly to your game and or site.

It must also have an style.styl file that contains variables and/or
variable arguments

- [Variables](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/docs/variables.md)
- [Variable Arguments](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/docs/vargs.md)

Turn it in
----------

Put it in your Git Folder as Week09-Site. Provide a link to your
repository.

Notes - Looking Ahead
---------------------

If you have any extra time, continue working on getting your game
integrated with CouchDb. We are probably going to focus on using
CouchDb from an Express application. Next week, I'm going to include
this integration of Express with CouchDb as part of the assignment,
so getting some work done in that area is a good idea.
