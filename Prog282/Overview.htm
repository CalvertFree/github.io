<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Welcome to Prog 282. You can read the syllabus here:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/YUJRsL">http://bit.ly/YUJRsL</a></p>
<h2 id="core-technologies">Core Technologies</h2>
<p>There are several technologies about which you cannot know too much while working in this class. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Node</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-os-knowledge">Important OS Knowledge</h2>
<p>You should also understand how to work with files on your operating system of choice. You are welcome to use Windows, the Mac or Linux. All that matters to me is that you know you how to work with files and directories on your system. In particular, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a text file</li>
<li>View the contents of a text file</li>
<li>View hidden hidden files</li>
<li>Create, move and delete files and directories</li>
<li>Find your home directory and start the path to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize that many students need to refresh their memory of this subject, but you should be prepared to learn how to work with files at the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, or Mac command prompt</li>
<li>Linux command prompt</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use Windows then you need to learn both the Windows and Linux command prompt. If you use the Mac, then you will find that the Linux and Mac command prompts are very similar.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-tools">Cloud Tools</h2>
<p>There are several tools we will use frequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>SSH (Putty)</li>
<li>VirtualBox, especially Ubuntu Linux running in VM.</li>
</ul>
<p>On AWS, we will focus on EC2 and S3, and on Google Drive we will focus on their document editor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Git is not an easy tool to learn, but this version control system has become ubiqutous in the Cloud and Internet communities.</p>
<p>On several occasions I have found students who are reluctant to learn both Git and SSH (Putty). I may be wrong, but I get the feeling that they keep hoping that these tools will miraculously disappear. This is not the case. They will be a presence in week 1 of the course, and will likely appear two out of every three weeks thereafter. I am concerned whenever a student has missed an important assignment, but even more important is the needs of other students in the class. If one student has done the work and wants to learn something new, it is very wrong for others to hold that student back and demand that class time be devoted to a subject that has already been covered in depth, and which is fully clear to most other students in the class.</p>
<p>If you know Git and SSH (Putty) you will find many tasks I ask you to perform relatively simple. If you don't know these tools, you will frequently think I am asking you to do the impossible. You will look at the person next to you, watch her whiz through an assignment, and come to the conclusion that the individual involved is some kind of genius who understands intuitively things that you will never understand. In general, this is not the case. It is just that they have done the work necessary to learn to learn Git and SSH. In some cases this was only an hour or two of effort, in other cases, it might take six or even eight hours of systained effort. This sounds like a lot, but is nothing compared to the long 10, 12, or 14 hour sessions you will spend trying to complete Git and SSH related tasks that I expected you to finish in twenty or thirty minutes at most.</p>
<h2 id="ides">IDEs</h2>
<p>The primary IDE's used in the class will be Eclipse and NotePad++ on Windows. On the Mac, you can use Eclipse and a text editor of your choice. At this time the Sublime editor is very popular, and many people like the open source Geany editor. There are good text editors that ship with the Mac.</p>
<h2 id="reading-elvenware">Reading Elvenware</h2>
<p>Almost everything we cover in class is covered somewhere on Elvenware. There is a search box on the home Elvenware home page. If you can't find where I discuss something, try using the search box:</p>
<p><a href="http://elvenware.com/charlie/">http://elvenware.com/charlie/</a></p>
<p>If there is something I covered in class that you wish was covered on Elvenware, please let me know.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>If you feel a bit overwhelmed, and that is natural, here are three things to focus your attention on:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript and Node</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll still have to come to terms with the Linux command prompt and SSH, but the above are things to focus on.</p>
