<h2 id="the-gitignore-file-and-nodemodules">The GitIgnore File and NodeModules</h2>
<p>Please try to ensure that you do not check in your node_modules directory to git. You can do this by placing a .gitignore file at the root of your repository with the following single line of code in it:</p>
<pre><code>node_modules</code></pre>
<p>Any files or directories listed in your .gitignore file will be ignored by git.</p>
<p>If you have already checked the node_modules directory for one or more of your projects into git you can remove them from the repository without deleting them from your hard drive with the following line of code:</p>
<pre><code>git rm --cached -r node_modules</code></pre>
<p>If you then do a push, the files will be removed from the remote copy of your repository. For instance, they will be removed from the copy of your repository that is hosted in BitBucket or GitHub.</p>
