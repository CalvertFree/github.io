<h1 id="canvas-grids">Canvas Grids</h1>
<p>Create a 12 X 12 grid of 25 X 25 bitmap images displayed in an HTML 5 canvas element. The user should be able to use the up, left, right and down keys to move a main character, represented by a second bit map, around on the grid.</p>
<p>The canvas element should be 12 X 25 pixels high, and 12 X 25 pixles wide.</p>
<p>Your program should include these files:</p>
<ul>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>index.js</li>
<li>images.gif</li>
<li>jquery-1.9.1.js</li>
</ul>
<p>You should have a document ready handler at the bottom of the javascript file. All the rest of your code should be inside one object that follows the modular pattern and is called Game.</p>
<p>Here is how to capture keydown events:</p>
<pre><code>    window.addEventListener(&#39;keydown&#39;, doKeyDown, true);
        
    var doKeyDown = function(evt) {
        switch (evt.keyCode) {
            case 38:
                /* Up arrow was pressed */
                break;
            case 40:
                /* Down arrow was pressed */
                break;
            case 37:
                /* Left arrow was pressed */
                break;
            case 39:
                /* Right arrow was pressed */
                break;
        }
    };</code></pre>
<p>When you are done, check your project into your Prog282-LastName folder, and make sure the folder is shared with me. When you turn in the assignment, include a link to your BitBucket home page or directly to your Prog282-LastName project.</p>
