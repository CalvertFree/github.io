   For classmates in Mr. Friedrich's class who haven't taken any of your courses and asked me how they can prep for PROG 282 over the break, I plan on sending them the following links to help them get started.
(I will suggest that they read the content to become familiar with some stuff of the tools and technologies will be using and have already used in the previous courses.)

JavaScript objects and functions - 
codeacademy.com  (try to complete the JavaScript, and HTML + CSS modules),
