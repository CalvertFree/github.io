<p>Create an <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> generated application that uses <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> and <a href="">Stylus</a>. Useful information can be found on the <a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/books/CloudNotes/Prog282/Week09.html">Week09-Overview</a> page.</p>
<p>It must have a main jade template madke from <strong>layout.jade</strong> and <strong>index.jade.</strong> The following pages should also be defined, and should use layout.jade:</p>
<ul>
<li>page01.jade</li>
<li>page02.jade</li>
<li>page03.jade</li>
<li>page04.jade</li>
</ul>
<p>There should be links to all these secondary pages from the main page. They should include a common <strong>nav</strong> section that is defined in <strong>layout.jade</strong>.</p>
<p>Also include a page called <strong>game.html</strong> that contains the current state of your game or class project. You do not need to include the sign in page. You can just go directly to your game and or site.</p>
<p>It must also have an style.styl file that contains variables and/or variable arguments</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/docs/variables.md">Variables</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/docs/vargs.md">Variable Arguments</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Put it in your Git Folder as Week09-Site. Provide a link to your repository.</p>

<p>If you have any extra time, continue working on getting your game integrated with CouchDb. We are probably going to focus on using CouchDb from an Express application. Next week, I'm going to include this integration of Express with CouchDb as part of the assignment, so getting some work done in that area is a good idea.</p>
