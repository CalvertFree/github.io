Week06-Overview
---------------

I'll pass out the midterm this week. You will get it on Wednesday, and
it will be due Sunday night. It will be open book, but will probably
be fairly time consuming, so you might begin planning for that contingency.
One thing is certain, if you start it on Sunday evening, you probably
won't do very well.

Major Topics
------------

* Interactions between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Sharing Data between Objects
* Working with Properties
* Unit test and Agile Programming
* Object Inheritance and Agile principle of Object Design.
* Working with XML

Properties
----------

- enumerable: Can it be enumerated?
- writable: Can its value be changed
- configurable: Can it be deleted, can its type be changed?
