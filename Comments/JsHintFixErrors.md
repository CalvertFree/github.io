# JsHint

As a general rule, students should not turn in JavaScript code that
does not come back clean when we run JsHint. If you have been linked to
this document, then I am probably asking that these problems be fixed
before I finish grading.

Please fix any errors you see, and then resubmit your assignment.

## Choosing a Reporter

It is important that you know how to handler the reporters that Grunt
and JsHint use to display error messages.

## Fixing Errors

We have two ways of reporting errors:

- [checkstyle][checkstyle]
- [jshint-stylish][jshint-stylish]
